# ODE-and-Integrals
- Individual Project1 PHY607
- This repository contains all the files required for ODE and integral calculation for project1. 
- Integration_project.py calculated moment of inertia for an annular disk with given inner and outer radius, and total mass of the disk.
- For integration_project.py, the user needs to enter inner radius, outer radius, total mass and number of steps. Please enter outer radius > inner radius strictly. You may take inner radius equal to zero to find the MOI for a disk.
- ode_project.py solves the ode for a system with a mass attached to two springs.
- For ode_project.py, user needs to enter the configuration of the springs (series or parallel), enter the values for spring constants for both the springs and the mass of the block, initial displacement and initial velocity of the block.
